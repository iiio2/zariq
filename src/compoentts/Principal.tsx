          <p className="lead">
            At Reverie School, our teachers and support staff are dedicated to
            developing and nurturing our students to be confident learners with
            strong grounding in proper ethics and become engaged citizens of
            Bangladesh. In addition to being taught the Pearson Edexcel
            curriculum, our students have the option to learn the Quran and the
            Arabic language and enjoy different sporting pursuits.

            Our school campus boasts a dedicated play-zone for young learners
            and state of the art science and computer laboratories for senior
            students. We have a special department dedicated solely for the
            memorization of the Holy Quran for both male and female students.

            Our school’s motto, “Knowledge, discipline and faith ”, highlights
            our commitment to provide quality, holistic education to all our
            students and guide them to be conscientious, morally upright
            individuals in this world and seek our Creator’s pleasure in the
            hereafter.
          </p>
          <p className="lead">
            With our vibrant and welcoming environment, we aim to develop a
            lifelong love for learning, empower students to work with Ihsan
            (excellence), be self-reliant and resilient, and be a positive part
            of the wider global community.
